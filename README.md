# Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analysis
This repo contains 3 Rmds for my manuscript "Lepidopteran granivory reduces seed counts in a rare species of riparian scour prairies" to be submitted to the Natural Areas Journal. 

The first Rmd [Preliminary Analyses and Tutorial](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Prelim_analyses_tutorial.Rmd) 
contains the part of a tutorial for an undergrad I developed, as well as test code for my analyses. 

The second Rmd contains the bulk of the code for this project [Fruit Granivory GLMs](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Fruit_GLMs.Rmd). 
It is well annotated code to complete generalized linear models for the two main questions in my mannuscript. 

Finally, [Seed Count ttest](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/seed_ttest.Rmd) is a ttest to compare 
the number of seeds we found in our sampled populations to the number of seeds expected based on plant keys.

You'll also find 2 data files that were used for all final analyses. [Prelim_Bap_fruit_data.csv](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Prelim_Bap_fruit_data.csv) is all raw data used for [Preliminary Analyses and Tutorial](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Prelim_analyses_tutorial.Rmd) and [Fruit Granivory GLMs](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Fruit_GLMs.Rmd).
[Baptisia_seed_counts.csv](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/Baptisia_seed_counts.csv) was used for the [Seed Count ttest](cheyennelmoore/Baptisia-Fruit-Data-Analyses/seed_ttest.Rmd) markdown. 

All code was written and annotated by me, Cheyenne Moore. 
All data was collected from a subset of populations of Baptisia australis var. australis along the Allegheny River in PA.
